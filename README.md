# Crafting Interpreters, but in Rust

This is the Java section of Crafting Interpreters, broadly translated into Rust. It's a learning experience for all of us. Fun.

## Challenges

You can find the extra challenges I've implemented on the branches `challenges/ch*`. E.g. you can find the Chapter 4 challenge about implementing C-style `/* ... */` block comments on the branch `challenges/ch4`.
